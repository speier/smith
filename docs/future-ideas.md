# Future Ideas

This document tracks potential future enhancements, interesting libraries, and inspiration for Smith development.

## Interesting Libraries & Tools

### Terminal UI / Rendering

- **Charm Crush v0.16.0 - Background Jobs** - https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/releases/tag/v0.16.0
  - *"The big, new feature today is background jobs! Crush can spawn and manage background jobs. Spin up servers, run parallel builds, and go crazy. The asynchronous world is now at your (LLM's) fingertips."*
  - **Idea for Smith**: Agent system could spawn and manage background jobs
  - Use cases: parallel builds, running servers during development, long-running tasks that agents can check back on
  - LLM-controlled async task management

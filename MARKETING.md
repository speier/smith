## Marketing Angles

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Smith turns conversations into code. You describe a feature in plain English, our AI architects break it down into tasks, and specialized agents build it while you watch. It's like having an entire development team in your terminal."

---

### Problem → Solution

**Traditional Development:**
```
Write code → Debug → Test → Review → Deploy
Hours of context switching, syntax errors, and tedious work
```

**With Smith:**
```
$ smith
You: "Add user authentication with JWT"
AI: [builds it while you get coffee]
```

### Press Release Draft

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Smith Launches: The First CLI IDE for Programming in English**

*Open-source tool lets developers build software through natural language conversations*

[DATE] — Smith, a revolutionary CLI development environment, launches today with a bold promise: program in English, not code.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that help developers write code faster, Smith replaces the coding process entirely. Developers describe features in plain English, and specialized AI agents plan, implement, test, and review the code automatically.

"We've reimagined development from the ground up," says [Your Name], creator of Smith. "Why should developers waste time on syntax and boilerplate when they could simply describe what they want to build?"

Smith features:
- Chat-first interface (REPL)
- Autonomous multi-agent system
- Kanban-style workflow
- Fully transparent & git-friendly

The tool is free, open-source, and available now at github.com/speier/smith.
